# Gitlab CI Toolbox ðŸ¦ŠðŸ› 

This repository contains a selection of reocurring solutions I've built with gitlab CI. As I found myself using similar images over and over again, I decided to create a "toolbox" which everyone can use.

## How does this work?

Within this repository you'll find folders containing solutions for different use cases. The all should contain a `readme.md` and a `gitlab-ci.yml` which you can directly use in your project.

However, some of those files need a little configuration to work with your usecase. You can find help in each corresponding readme.

## Anything is wrong/faulty/inefficient?

Now that you found out... why not prepare a pull request? I'd love to receive contributions and learn something new. ðŸ˜ƒ
